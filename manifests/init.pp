#
# == Class: pam
#
# This class ensures that reasonable PAM security options are applied.
#
# == Global Variables
#
# $rsync_server
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*cracklib_difok*]
#   The number of character changes between the old password and the new
#   password that are enough to accept the new password. The default is 4.
#
# [*cracklib_maxrepeat*]
#   Reject passwords which contain more than N same consecutive characters.
#
# [*cracklib_maxsequence*]
#   Reject passwords which contain monotonic character sequences
#   longer than N.  The default is 0 which means that this check is
#   disabled. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note
#   that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless
#   the sequence is only a minor part of the password.
#
# [*cracklib_maxclassrepeat*]
#   Reject passwords which contain more than N consecutive characters
#   of the same class.  The default is 0 which means that this check
#   is disabled.
#
# [*cracklib_reject_username*]
#   Check whether the name of the user in straight or reversed form is
#   contained in the new password. If it is found the new password is
#   rejected.
#
# [*cracklib_gecoscheck*]
#   Type: Boolean
#
#   Check whether the words from the GECOS field (usualy full name of
#   the user) longer than 3 characters in straight or reversed form
#   are contained in the new password. If any such word is found the
#   new password is rejected.
#
# [*cracklib_enforce_for_root*]
#   Type: Boolean
#
#   The module will return error on failed check also if the user
#   changing the password is root. This option is off by default which
#   means that just the message about the failed check is printed but
#   root can change the password anyway.
#
# [*cracklib_dcredit*]
#   Type: Positive or Negative Integer
#
#   (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having digits in the new
#   password.  If you have less than or N digits, each digit will
#   count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The default for
#   dcredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen less than
#   10.
#
#   (N < 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for
#   a new password.
#
# [*cracklib_ucredit*]
#   Type: Positive or Negative Integer
#
#   (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having upper case letters
#   in the new password.  If you have less than or N digits, each
#   digit will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The
#   default for dcredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen
#   less than 10.
#
#   (N < 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for
#   a new password.
#
# [*cracklib_lcredit*]
#   Type: Positive or Negative Integer
#
#   (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having lower case letters
#   in the new password.  If you have less than or N digits, each
#   digit will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The
#   default for dcredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen
#   less than 10.
#
#   (N < 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for
#   a new password.
#
# [*cracklib_ocredit*]
#   Type: Positive or Negative Integer
#
#   (N >= 0) This is the maximum credit for having other characters in
#   the new password.  If you have less than or N digits, each digit
#   will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value. The
#   default for dcredit is 1 which is the recommended value for minlen
#   less than 10.
#
#   (N < 0) This is the minimum number of digits that must be met for
#   a new password.
#
# [*cracklib_minclass*]
#   The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new
#   password. The default number is three. The four classes are digits,
#   upper and lower letters and other characters.  The difference to
#   the credit check is that a specific class if of characters is not
#   required.  Instead N out of four of the classes are required.
#
# [*cracklib_minlen*]
#   The minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if
#   credits are not disabled which is the default). In addition to the
#   number of characters in the new password, credit (of +1 in length)
#   is given for each different kind of character (other, upper, lower
#   and digit).  The default for this parameter is 14.
#
# [*cracklib_retry*]
#   Prompt user at most N times before returning with error.
#
# [*deny*]
#   The number of failed attempts before PAM denies a user from logging in.
#
# [*display_account_lock*]
#   Whether or not to display to the remote user that their account
#   has been locked.
#
# [*homedir_umask*]
#   Sets the file mode creation mask of the user home directories.
#
# [*remember*]
#   The last n passwords for each user are saved in /etc/security/opasswd in
#   order to force password change history and keep the user from alternating
#   between the same password too frequently.
#   Defaults to 24.
#
# [*remember_retry*]
#   Type: Integer
#   Default: 1
#     Allow this many retries for a valid password
#
# [*remember_for_root*]
#   Type: Boolean
#   Default: true
#     If set, also remember the last ``$remember`` passwords for the root user.
#
# [*root_unlock_time*]
#   Allow access after n seconds to root account after failed attempt.
#
# [*rounds*]
#   Set the optional number of rounds of the SHA256, SHA512 and blowfish password hashing algorithms to n.
#   Defaults to 10000.
#
# [*uid*]
#   Allow user logins for userse with UID higher than n. Default is 500 (system users on RedHat).
#
# [*unlock_time*]
#   Allow acesss after n seconds to user account after failed attempt.
#
# [*preserve_ac*]
#   Keep the original -ac file around for reference.
#
# [*warn_if_unknown*]
#   If you make it to the 'other' PAM configuration file, then warn
#   about this if this setting is not 'false'.
#
# [*deny_if_unknown*]
#   Type: Boolean
#   Default: true
#     If true, deny any access to an application that falls all the
#     way through the PAM stack.
#
# [*use_ldap*]
#   Default: true
#   Set PAM up to use LDAP connections.
#
# [*use_netgroups*]
#   Default: false
#   Set PAM up to use NIS netgroups.
#
# [*use_openshift*]
#   Default: false
#   Set PAM to work well with OpenShift.
#
# [*use_sssd*]
#   Default: false
#   Set PAM to work with SSSD.
#
# [*tty_audit_enable*]
#   Default: [ 'root' ]
#   The users for which TTY auditing is enabled. Set to an empty Array to not audit TTY actions for any user.
#
# [*auth_sections*]
#   Default: [ 'fingerprint', 'system', 'password', 'smartcard' ]
#   The PAM '*-auth' files to manage. Set to an empty Array to not manage any sections by default.
