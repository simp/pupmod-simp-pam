# This class ensures that reasonable PAM security options are applied.
#
# It also takes into account the global SIMP settings for LDAP and SSSD.
#
# Many options are exposed here that may affect a large number of lower-level
# PAM module settings. This is done to provide continuity across the PAM stack
# where possible.
#
# @param password_check_backend
#   The password checking library to use
#
#   * The default is based on the OS being targeted and is pulled from module
#     data
#
# @param locale_file
#   The path to the `locale` configuration file on the system
#
#   * Explicitly set to `undef` to disable
#
# @param cracklib_difok
#   The number of character changes between the old password and the new
#   password that are enough to accept the new password
#
# @param cracklib_maxrepeat
#   Reject passwords which contain more than this many of the same consecutive
#   characters
#
# @param cracklib_maxsequence
#   Reject passwords which contain monotonic character sequences
#   longer than this
#
#   * The default is 0 which means that this check is disabled. Examples of
#     such sequence are ``12345`` or ``fedcb``
#
#   * Most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the
#     sequence is only a minor part of the password
#
# @param cracklib_maxclassrepeat
#   Reject passwords which contain more than this many consecutive characters
#   of the **same class**
#
#   * Character classes include:
#       * Upper Case
#       * Lower Case
#       * Digit
#       * Special Character
#
# @param cracklib_gecoscheck
#   Check whether the words from the GECOS field (usualy full name of the user)
#   longer than 3 characters in straight or reversed form are contained in the
#   new password
#
# @param cracklib_enforce_for_root
#   Enforce all password check settings for the ``root`` user
#
# @param cracklib_dcredit
#   The required credit for having digits in the new password
#
#   * For Positive Integers: If you have less than or N digits, each digit will
#     count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value
#
#   * For Negative Integers: The minimum number of digits that must be met for
#     a new password
#
# @param cracklib_ucredit
#   The required credit for having upper case letters in the new password
#
#   * For Positive Integers: If you have less than or N characters , each
#     character will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value
#
#   * For Negative Integers: The minimum number of characters that must be met
#     for a new password
#
# @param cracklib_lcredit
#   The required credit for having lower case letters in the new password
#
#   * For Positive Integers: If you have less than or N characters , each
#     character will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value
#
#   * For Negative Integers: The minimum number of characters that must be met
#     for a new password
#
# @param cracklib_ocredit
#   The required credit for having special characters in the new password
#
#   * For Positive Integers: If you have less than or N characters , each
#     character will count +1 towards meeting the current minlen value
#
#   * For Negative Integers: The minimum number of characters that must be met
#     for a new password
#
# @param cracklib_minclass
#   The minimum number of required classes for the new password
#
#   * The four classes are digits, upper and lower letters and other characters
#
#   * The difference to the credit check is that a specific class if of
#     characters is not required.  Instead N out of four of the classes are
#     required.
#
# @param cracklib_minlen
#   The minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are
#   not disabled)
#
# @param cracklib_reject_username
#   Don't let the username be used in password
#
# @param cracklib_retry
#   Prompt user at most N times before returning with error
#
# @param cracklib_badwords
#   Array of words that must not be contained in the password.
#   These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check.
#
# @param cracklib_dictpath
#   Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default.
#
# @param rm_pwquality_conf_d
#   Remove the /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d directory and all contents.
#
#   * This ensures authoritative management of ``pwquality`` without the
#     ability of users to override our settings directly on the system.
#
# @param deny
#   The number of failed attempts before PAM denies a user from logging in
#
# @param display_account_lock
#   Display to the remote user that their account has been locked
#
# @param fail_interval
#   Sets the time until the check fails
#
# @param homedir_umask
#   Sets the file mode creation mask of the user home directories
#
# @param remember
#   The last N passwords for each user are saved in ``/etc/security/opasswd``
#   in order to force password change history and keep the user from
#   alternating between the same password too frequently
#
# @param remember_retry
#   Allow this many retries
#
# @param remember_for_root
#   Remember the last ``$remember`` passwords for the root user
#
# @param even_deny_root
#   Enforce an account lockout for the ``root`` account
#
# @param root_unlock_time
#   Allow access after N seconds to root account after failed attempt
#
#   * Has no effect if ``even_deny_root`` is not set
#

#   The password hashing algorithm to use
#
# @param rounds
#   Set the optional number of rounds of the ``SHA256``, ``SHA512`` and
#   ``Blowfish`` password hashing algorithms to N
#
# @param uid
#   Allow user logins for userse with UID higher than N
#
# @param unlock_time
#   Allow acesss after N seconds to user account after failed attempt
#
# @param preserve_ac
#   Keep the original ``-ac`` files around for reference
#
# @param warn_if_unknown
#   If you make it to the ``other`` PAM configuration file, then provide a
#   warning that the login method was uncaught by other PAM stacks
#
# @param oath  Configures  to use pam_oath TOTP in the system-auth pam stack.
#   Inherits from simp_options::oath, defaults to false if not found. 
#   WARNING: pupmod-simp-oath is a dependency of this option. If this is 
#            set to true without the oath module, you will be unable to
#            log in locally!
#
# @param oath_window  Sets the TOTP window (Defined in RFC 6238 section 5.2)
#
# @param deny_if_unknown
#   If true, deny any access to an application that falls all the way through
#   the PAM stack to ``other``
#
# @param use_netgroups
#   Default: false
#   Set PAM up to use NIS netgroups.
#

#   templated content

#   templated content
#
# @param auth_sections
#   The PAM ``*-auth`` files to manage
#
#   * Set to an empty Array to not manage any sections
#
# @param fingerprint_auth_content
#   The content that should be used to fill ``/etc/pam.d/fingerprint_auth``
#   instead of the templated content
#
# @param system_auth_content
#   The content that should be used to fill ``/etc/pam.d/system_auth`` instead
#   of the templated content
#
# @param password_auth_content

#   instead of the templated content
#
# @param smartcard_auth_content

#   instead of the templated content
#
# @param enable

#     Use with caution
#
# @param separator
#   Separator to use for user and origin lists
