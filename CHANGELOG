  LDAP and the local group to be able to su when LDAP is down or an emergency
  user is local.

* Thu Oct 27 2011 Maintenance - 2.0.0-4
- Added the new 'auth' portions of pam.d and removed everything except for
  'other' from the rsync segment of pam.d.

* Mon Oct 10 2011 Maintenance - 2.0.0-3
- Updated to put quotes around everything that need it in a comparison
  statement so that puppet > 2.5 doesn't explode with an undef error.

  LDAP.

* Tue Jun 07 2011 Maintenance - 2.0.0-2
- Rearranged items in system-auth so that fewer erroneous errors would be
  thrown on login. You'll still get them if logging in as a local user. Red Hat
  is aware of the issue.

- Default password length is now 14
- Removed nullok to prevent all blank password usage

- Refactored for SIMP-2.0.0-alpha release

* Mon Jan 10 2011 Maintenance - 1.0-4
- Updated the PAM configuration to fix an issue where pam_unix.so was set to
  default=ignore. This is definitely not what you want.

* Thu Nov 04 2010 Maintenance - 1.0-3
- pam_tally2 still wasn't properly taking  effect. Should be corrected.
- This update adds the ability to modify the delay after a failed login via
  PAM.  FAIL_DELAY by itself doesn't do anything without the addition of
  pam_faildelay.so this item was added to the default PAM config.

* Tue Oct 26 2010 Maintenance - 1.0-2
- Converting all spec files to check for directories prior to copy.

* Tue Aug 10 2010 Maintenance - 1.0-1
- Rearranged the pam_tally2 items in system-auth.erb to ensure that account
  lockouts are taking effect properly.

* Fri Jun 04 2010 Maintenance - 1.0-0
- Modified the system-auth.erb file to:
  - Get rid of session messages in /var/log/secure when cron runs.
  - Ensure that cron can run without having a user in the groupaccess.conf file.
  - Skip pam_ldap if pam_unix succeeds.
- Code refactor and update
- Added 'Tidy' statements to match the rest of the multi-build patterns.
- Fixed a problem with pam_succeed_if.so uid=0 causing auid to be set to -1. Changed to user = root.
- Changed the pam_mkhomedir call to be 'optional' instead of 'required'. This
  allows users to login even if their home directory can't be created.

* Fri Feb 05 2010 Maintenance - 0.1-10
- Fixed some incorrect settings with pam_cracklib.so and added in some new
  checking functionality for repeated characters and username matching.
- Removed the necessity of the rootaccess file. This does mean that root can su
  to any user but completely prevents root lockouts.
