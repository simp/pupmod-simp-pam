# EL8 OS capabilities
# EL8 supports newer pwquality options and config files
#
# NOTE: The 'retry' option was introduced in RHEL 8.4. If you are deploying
# to RHEL/CentOS 8.0-8.3, you should override pam::cracklib_retry_supported
# to false in your Hiera data. These older minor versions are now end-of-life
# and are not commonly deployed.
